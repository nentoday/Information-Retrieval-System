# Information-Retrieval-System

This is a github page for our Information Retrieval System. As a team, we are working on creating a webpage focused on allowing users to search for and retrieve OSINT-Focused infomation that we have gathered. We have scraped publically available articles and posts, with categories related to cybersecurity and space activity. All of these articles have been separated into thier own csv files that will then be transfered into a database. Finally, we create a front-end webpage to allow for users to search for specific articles and retrieve whatever information they are interested in.

# Features

- The key features of this github page are the csv files we have uploaded. Each CSV file has been separated into folders based on which keyword they are related to.
- We will also add the front-end webpage once that is completed.
